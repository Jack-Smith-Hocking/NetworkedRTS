== Mechanics == 
- Change how AIActions are managed
  - Instead of having a different button for each action have it so that each object will hold the action that a unit can perform on it
  - To test if the AIAgent can perform the action check their PossibleActionsDict against the action that can be performed
  - Initial method will stil be used for buildings so that you know which unit will be built
    - Perhaps develope a better way for this to work
    - Have it so that a building has a position that new units will be spawned at, so when you press a button to spawn a unit
    - It will spawn and then walk to that position
    - Can then have this position confirgurable using the other proposed idea for input management
- See about getting actual networking to work, Cross-Network rather than simply on the same network

== Looks ==
- Change how objects look when selected
  - Instead of turning them blue and green, have a marker appear under/above them
  - Possibly use rim lighting or an outline effect as well/instead
- Make ResourcePiles more stand out more so that players can tell that resources can be collected from them
